git remote manages the remote repositories whose branches you track.

git remote 		- lists all remotes
git remote add origin https://github.com/lbrange/conscridoc.git
git remote rename origin github		change the default branch name
					from master to github


git push -u <repository> <refspec>
	-u 		add upstream tracking reference
	<repository>	remote repository
	<refspec>	
	   The format of a <refspec> parameter is an optional plus +, followed by the source ref <src>,
           followed by a colon :, followed by the destination ref <dst>. It is used to specify with what
           <src> object the <dst> ref in the remote repository is to be updated.

           The <src> is often the name of the branch you would want to push, but it can be any arbitrary
           "SHA-1 expression", such as master~4 or HEAD (see gitrevisions(7)).

           The <dst> tells which ref on the remote side is updated with this push. Arbitrary expressions
           cannot be used here, an actual ref must be named. If :<dst> is omitted, the same ref as <src> will
           be updated.

git push -u github work
Branch work set up to track remote branch work from github.
This created branch 'work' in github i.e. not 'master' as usual.


git branch --set-upstream <local branch> <remote branch>

Create new branch and let it track work:
	git checkout -b work-also-tracking-work --track github/work
